                    "description": "New Relic is used for the purposes of monitoring and analyzing rtci application data. New Relic monitors each application within rtci for basic container utilization (CPU, memory, disk) as a baseline of provided metrics. New Relic dashboards are used by rtci operations to obtain near real-time views into the metrics obtained from each application. New Relic provides application metrics that give insight into request/response rates, failure rates, etc. New Relic uses this data to detect anomalies (such as potential unauthorized activity) and alerts the rtci team via <<INSERT NOTIFICATION CHANNEL>> in the GSA Slack. Example: a spike in failed requests may indicate an unauthorized user has entered the system and is attempting to phish for PII.\n\n1. A subset of relevant specific metrics rtci is constantly monitoring include:\n* Abnormal cpu, memory, and disk utilization (defined in New Relic alerting rules)\n* Number of incoming requests\n* Request response time\n* Application crashes (for any reason)\n* Response status codes (high numbers of failing requests would be abnormal)\n* Applications (by name)\n* Abnormally high request rates\n1. Metrics that can be audited within rtci include:\n* SSH Sessions (disabled in production under normal circumstances)\n1. A subset of relevant incidents rtci will use these metrics to protect against include:\n* Unauthorized Access / Intrusion to rtci as an Administrator\n* Denial of Service (DoS)\n* Improper Usage\n* Malicious Code\n* System Uptime\n* High Resource Usage\n\nWhen suspicious activity is encountered rtci Operations audit the event through the cloud.gov logs provided at logs.fr.cloud.gov\n(a Kibana instance allowing users to access, filter, and search their cloud.gov logs. These logs are retained automatically by cloud.gov for 180 days after creation.",
